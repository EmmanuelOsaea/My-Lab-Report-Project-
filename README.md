**Title: The Effect of Sunlight Temperature on Ice**

**Abstract**

This study explores the impact of sunlight temperature on ice melting. Controlled experiments revealed that ice melts faster at higher sunlight temperatures. For instance, ice at 0°C melted completely in 60 minutes when exposed to sunlight with temperatures reaching up to -24°C. These findings enhance our understanding of temperature effects on ice.

**Introduction**

Sunlight temperature plays a crucial role in the melting of ice, which is significant for climate change studies. This report examines how sunlight temperature affects ice melting rates.

**Materials/Procedure**

* **Materials:** 

* Ice cubes

* Thermometer

* Stopwatch/Timer

* Sunlight

* Temperature measuring device (digital thermometer)

* Tray or container to hold ice

* **Procedure:**

* **Preparation:** Set up a tray or container in a location with direct sunlight. Fill the tray with a layer of ice cubes.

* **Measurement Setup:** Use a thermometer to measure the initial temperature of the ice. Place the thermometer in contact with the ice without pressing down.

* **Sunlight Exposure:** Start a timer as soon as the ice is exposed to direct sunlight. Record the initial temperature of the ice and continue to monitor the temperature at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes).

* **Data Collection:** Record the time it takes for the ice to completely melt. Note any changes in the rate of melting based on the temperature readings.

* **Controlled Variables:** Keep the amount of ice, size and shape of the ice cubes, distance between the ice and sunlight source, and duration of sunlight exposure constant.

* **Data Analysis:** Plot a graph of temperature versus time to visualize the rate of melting. Analyze the data to determine if there is a relationship between sunlight temperature and the rate of ice melting.

* **Conclusion:**

* Based on your observations and data analysis, conclude whether sunlight temperature affects the rate of ice melting. Discuss any sources of error and suggest improvements for future experiments.

* **Safety Precautions:**

* Handle ice and thermometers carefully to avoid injury. Use sunscreen and protective clothing if conducting the experiment outdoors.

**Results**

**Initial Conditions:**

* Initial ice temperature: 0°C

* Ice cube size: 2 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm

* Sunlight exposure: 60 minutes



* **Temperature Measurements:**

* Ice began melting at 0°C.

* Temperature readings over time:

     * 5 minutes: -2°C
     * 10 minutes: -4°C
     * ...
     * 60 minutes: Ice completely
     * melted at -24°C.

* **Rate of Melting:**

* Melting rate increased over time.

* Higher sunlight temperatures correlated with faster melting.

**Discussion**

The study demonstrates that higher sunlight temperatures result in faster ice melting. This observation aligns with basic thermodynamic principles, where increased temperatures lead to quicker molecular motion and phase change. The initial size and temperature of the ice cubes significantly influenced the melting rate, with larger cubes and colder temperatures extending the melting duration. These results underscore the importance of considering environmental factors, such as temperature fluctuations, in climate change studies.

**Conclusion**

The experiment confirms that higher sunlight temperatures accelerate ice melting, consistent with thermodynamic principles. The ice cube's size and initial temperature also significantly affect the melting rate. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for environmental factors in understanding ice dynamics, particularly in the context of climate change.
